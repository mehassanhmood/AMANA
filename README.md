#### The Idea:    
1. With the advent of technology the world has changed to a global village. AMANA's goal is to connect talents and recruiters wherever they are in the world while leveraging the power of blockchain!
2. Humans every where have the same basic requirements to survive, why can't we have a universal currency system that we can use to exchange services?
3. Maybe finding talent is becoming easy in this global village, but how do you ensure the trust between the two parties? How do you secure the payment exchange? How can you implement a trustworthy review system?  How do you avoid charging high fees on clients?These are all problems that the traditional freelancer marketplace deal with and we believe that this is wahat Amana can solve.
#### Blockchain is the answer:
1. AMANA is a freelance marketplace built on the blockchain. The freelancers and clients agreements will be all stored in a smart contract in the Ethereum blockchain, providing safety and trust to both parties. Payments are stored in escrow accounts until the job is completed.
2. With our platform people can make use of each others ability with the exchange of a currency that knows no boundries "Cryptocurrency", and for this purpose we would make use of stable coin to equip users to over come the harsh boudries of inter-country regulations surrounding fiat transfer.
3. We aim to proceed with the basic features of blockchain, i.e : 
    1. Trust.
    2. Transparency.
    3. Security via smart contract.
4. AMANA's Features:
    1. User Profile Creation
    2. Job Posting as ERC-721 Tokens
    3. Client Job Search
    4. Communication Channel
    5. Smart Contracts for Jobs Executions
    6. Purchase of ERC-721 Token in our platform
    7. Payment System using stable coin (USDT)
    8. Reviews Posted to the Ethereum Blockchain

#### AMANA Notes:
1. The starter code files have `pragma solidity ^0.5.0'
2. Ganache is used as local block chain testing network.
3. MetaMask is used as the local wallet connected to Ganache.
#### Technical Overview:
1. Following general steps were followed for our first MVP:
    1. Designing and compiling the smart contract with the requisites fullfiling the basic concepts of our idea.
    2. Deploying the smart contract on a test environment using Ganache , through MetaMask wallet.
    3. Testing the end to end functionality of the smart contract
    4. Connecting the smart contract with a StreamLit code
    5. Building the user interface on Streamlit for both client and freelancer
2. Technology and Software used:
    1. Remix IDE for Smart Contract.
    2. Solidity
    3. Rinkbey TestNet
    4. Pinata
    5. Metamask (Wallet).
